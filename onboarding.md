# Onboarding

Welcome to the lab!

Important information for new hires. **We highly recommend getting a *ucdavis email address* before arriving**.  This will allow you to complete online safety training before arriving in the lab, which is necessary if you want to hit the ground running.  It is also okay if you do not complete all training before your first day, but you cannot work until you complete the training. 

As a new member in the lab, please contribute to this document to help streamline the process for future people who join the lab. *Especially take note of any broken links & use Google / people in the lab to fix them as UC Davis is likely to move URLs around.*

**Before you work in the lab**

## Expectations

I expect everyone to maintain positive, solution-oriented attitudes and approach their work with curiosity, creativity, and hard work.  

Familiarize yourself with the [lab handbook](lab_handbook.md). You don't have to remember all of the details. But you should read it carefully at least once.  And then go back to re-read specific sections when it is appropriate. It is a single document to make it easy to Ctrl+F Search. If I make signficant changes to content sections, I will notify the lab via our lab Slack. 

## Fill out the Workstyle questionnaire
When you join the lab, I ask that you fill out the [Workstyle Questionaire](https://forms.gle/i8mJ7ZLnuKyRjQfBA). Send me a Slack DM or Email to let me know you filled it out. 

## Emergency Contact Information. 
Please add yourself to the [Contact sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fjm018tf4Xtbagq4xlW4ew76mxHWtCQRTvE4sgNhVUs/edit#gid=0). Add your labmates' phone numbers into your phone in case of emergency. 

## Required Safety Training

Here is the list of documents and training that you need to complete. Once you complete them, please let me know or ask me any questions. In addition to this list we will do the initial training which is a walk through in the lab so make sure that before the initial training you already finished the UC laboratory Safety Fundamentals training (see more info below).

### **Online safety training** 

Located at [lms.ucdavis.edu]([https://lms.ucdavis.edu/). To access the courses, email the plant pathology Safety guru Andy Ross (abross@ucdavis.edu) to request the training and copy Tiffany:

```
Hello Andy,

I am a new lab member of the Lowe-Power lab. Can you assign the LMS trainings to me?

Full name: XXXXXX
@ucdavis email account: XXXXXX

1. eCourse:UC Laboratory Safety Fundamentals (Initial Training)
2. Proper Handling of Materials at Biosafety Level 1 
3. UC DAVIS BIOSAFETY LEVEL 2 ONLINE TRAINING
4. Safe Use of Biological Safety Cabinets
5. eCourse:Cryogen Safety 

Thank you,
```
These trainings are long, but that is because they cover safety in sufficient detail to be useful. Although it's technically possible to "test out" of the training with the quiz, *I expect you to watch the videos in full with your full attention and then completing the quiz*. 

Before starting in the lab:
1. eCourse:UC Laboratory Safety Fundamentals (Initial Training). This takes 1 hr, but you can save progress as you go. 
1. **PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) training**. This takes only 10 minutes. After taking this one you can print the voucher and you can go to VetMed store in Haring hall building and purchase your blue lab coat and safety glasses. *Before you go, check with me because it is possible that I can assign you one of the extra lab coats that we have in the lab.* You will find this training at LHAT website (https://ehs.ucop.edu/lhat/), only you will be able to log in into this website once I add you to the lab roster, wait to receive the invitation. Also from this website you need to certify the Lab Assessment, when you log in the first time you will see in the home page two red check marks, please check on them and the website will walk you through everything. Don't hesitate to ask me questions.

Before working on any bacteria in the lab:
1. Proper Handling of Materials at Biosafety Level 1 
1. UC DAVIS BIOSAFETY LEVEL 2 ONLINE TRAINING
1. Read the Biological Usage Authorization (BUA) for our lab. (located in Box > LPlab-shared >  2 - Lab Management > safety [Or at this link that requires you to log in with your UCD credentials](https://ucdavis.box.com/s/zf3sbnx7qj6saht8ygxu039j1cjawhi2)).  If you don't have access, ask on Slack in the #safety channel.

Before using the biological safety cabinet or cryogens (dry ice, liq N2):
1. Safe Use of Biological Safety Cabinets
1. eCourse:Cryogen Safety 

Every 3 years:
1. eCourse:UC Laboratory Safety Fundamentals Refresher 

### Chemical Hygiene Plan
Understand the contents of the Chemical Hygiene Plan (CHP): https://safetyservices.ucdavis.edu/article/laboratory-safety-manual. Most of the contents is targeted at lab personnel (you), but you can skip sections targeted at fire personnel, janitorial staff, etc. 

* Please download the CHP document to your lab laptop because during the safety inspections, the inspector can ask you if you know where to find it. We have three annually different inspections: fire inspection (usually in May), EH&S inspection (every January) and BUA audit (September). 
* **Sign the Documentation of Training form in the "Safety Binder"**.


### Material Safety Data Sheets (SSDS) for chemicals
Please bookmark the link below. It is to search for MSDS (Material Safety data sheets). Before you work with any chemical it is very important to check MSDS and learn how you should work with that specific chemical and what to do in case of an accident or spilling.
http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/safety-center.html


### Department Safety Training (required). 
Navigate to to the [Department's Safety website](http://plantpathology.ucdavis.edu/safety.cfm), and familiarize yourself with the content. 
You are *required to read* and then **sign the documentation form** in the "Safety Binder". 
* Injury and Illness Prevention Program (IIPP)
* Emergency Action Plan (EAP)
* SOPs (Standard operating procedures) when working with specific chemicals with Hazards. 

**Lab-Specific Safety Training**. Before experiments begin in the lab, you'll need to go through the initial safety training with the lab's safety coordinator (As of Jan 2021, Nathalie Aoun)

When you complete this training, you can take the signed form to the Purchasing Office administrators in 355 Hutchison Hall.  They will issue you keys to the labspace.  

**Read the lab SOPs** and then sign the form in the "Safety Binder". These are printed in the binder and also in Box > 2 - Lab Management > Lowepowerlab SOPs

**Remind the safety officer to add you to safety paperwork**

Send this email to the safety officer:

```

Hello Nathalie,

Please add me to 
1. LHAT/RSS system: ehs.ucop.edu.
2. The BioSafety BUA website

Thank you

```

**Safety questions**.  It is important to identify safety risks and work with the lab safety coordinator, Tiffany, labmates, and EH&S to identify safe ways to proceed. Bring up all safety concerns on the lab's Slack (**# safety** channel) to open a discussion. Public discussion will help your labmates also adopt safety best-practices.

**Lab-safe clothing**. Make sure you have appropriate attire:
* **Shoes**: closed-toe, closed heel. Non-absorbant material is *strongly* recommended. 
    * Need inspiration for smart-looking shoes that are also lab safe? Check out online communities: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/search?q=lab+shoes&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) and [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/search?q=lab+shoes&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all). 
* **Pants / other bottoms**: Between tall socks, leggings, or pants, you'll need to ensure you don't have skin exposed. 
* General considerations: Avoid clothing that is too drapey & could fall into a bunsen burner / beaker of bacteria / etc. (Especially trendy sleeves on shirts).

### Optional Training

**Hazardous Shipping**.  If you are a full-time lab member (grad student / postdoc / junior specialist, etc), you are likely to ship or receive packages to/from collaborators.  Take the *Hazardous Shipping Training* in LMS to identify hazards and ship appropriately. Before shipping anything, re-take the training and then use **AggieShip** to generate a shipment.

# Misc.

## Familiarize Yourself with Common Lab Terms

[Lowe-Power Lab Glossary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19AsPkU6nHJzNodnoK5z-z4G0OHRLERk6mvZZazWm8Hs/edit?usp=sharing)

This link gives access for viewing and leaving comments if you have questions or want to suggest changes.

## Adding yourself to the lab website

I encourage everyone to be represented on the lab website http://lowepowerlab.ucdavis.edu/people. This is really helpful for you being present in the Plant Pathology dept community. Neighbor labs will often use the directory to learn people's names when they are embarrased that they forgot them.

Add yourself to the website by getting access to the [lab GitHub website repo](https://github.com/lowepowerlab/lowepowerlab.github.io) & editing the people.md markdown file within /_pages/ folder. 

OR

Please send Tiffany an email asking her to add you. 
1. a photo cropped to be a headshot. 
2. Your education information (previous degrees, current majors, etc). You don't have to provide high school information because that's oddly a security question on a lot of websites...
3. Any hobbies / interests you'd like to share with the lab.
4. If you feel strongly that you don't want your email address on the website, let me know. 

## Where to find administrative help (HR, Purchasing, Travel, IT, etc)

The Plant Pathology dept shares admin staff with the Entomology & Nematology depts. They are named the Phoenix Cluster. Familiarize yourself with [the Phoenix Website](https://phoenix.ucdavis.edu/)--especially the links to the side of the page. Also, you might have reasons to direct questions to a specific department (e.g. HR, Purchasing, Travel, IT, etc.), so you can find their (mailing lists here)[https://phoenix.ucdavis.edu/departmental-mailing-lists]. The staff's offices are located on the 3rd floor of Hutchison and in Briggs Hall, and they are friendly people who can help you with walk-in questions. 

Tiffany and current lab members can also point you in the direction of an admin to help you solve your problems. 

As in keeping with our lab culture, always be kind and respectful with admin staff. 

## Living in Davis

The [Maloof lab](http://malooflab.phytonetworks.org/wiki/) at UC Davis has some great information.

### Places to find short-term rentals (< 1 yr>)

This will take effort. Davis is a small college town & the rental market is heavily tied to the academic year.  We should try to time short-visits to academic year (operates on quarter system [Find dates on UCD website](https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/calendar/quarter)). Housing will be cheapest over summer quarter when undergrads vacate apartments. 

There are a few Communities where you can find open rooms:
- https://www.facebook.com/groups/286762898448011/ UC Davis Housing--Grad/Professional Students
- https://www.facebook.com/groups/763250590497811/ UC Davis Off-Campus Housing
- https://www.facebook.com/groups/536715989682604/ Apt/Rooms for Rent for our International Davis Community
- https://www.facebook.com/groups/335826596627749/ University of California, Davis (UCD) Housing, Sublets & Roommates
- https://campuscribz.com/map?location=38.54783,-121.74090&zoom=15 UC Davis – CampusCribz

This is just a starter list. Craigslist and AirBnB are also potential options.

# Undergraduate-specific information
You will be paired with a mentor. The mentor will usually be a current graduate student, junior specialist, postdoc, or rarely the principle investigator (Tiffany). This mentor is volunteering their time to train you. Please respect their time and expertise. Mentored research is a great opportunity to be apprenticed by a scientist and learn both techniques and critical thinking skills. The amount of learning and experience you gain from this experience is proportional to your motivation, curiosity, and attention. If you are too busy to fully participate and take advantage of this opportunity in a certain quarter, communicate that.  This will allow our lab to use our finite time to mentor someone who can take advantage of the opportunity.
